### part II - setting up the script

- rename "chatData.template.db" to "config.ini"
- unzip the folder and open "config.template.ini" in a text editor
- rename it to "config.ini"
- fill in each line for each section you plan on using
- if you're using chatPlays.py be sure to change the controller to fit whatever game you're using it for
- once you have the config set up can run the script

### part III - setting up twitch
- log into your [dev account](https://dev.twitch.tv/)
- go to "name's Console" then "Applications"
- click "Register Application" and fill out all the information boxes however you want but add "http://localhost/" as the redirect url
- go back to "Applications" then click "Manage" on the one you just made
- you should see "Client ID" near the bottom of the page
- paste said id into the twitch client id section in the python file
- paste "https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/authorize?client_id=CLIENT_ID_HERE&redirect_uri=http://localhost/&response_type=token&scope=viewing_activity_read+channel:manage:raids+chat:edit+chat:read+moderator:manage:banned_users+moderator:read:chatters+channel:manage:moderators" into your browser
- replace "CLIENT_ID_HERE" with your id and go to the url
- you should be redirected to a new url that contains "access_token="
- copy and paste that long ass string into the twitch access token section

### part IV - setting up spotify
  - login to [spotify developers](https://developer.spotify.com/) and go to your dashboard
  - click "Create App" and set http://localhost:8888/callback as the redirect url
  - go to the app then click "Settings" and you should see "Client ID" and "Client secret" near the top
  - paste these into your config file at their respective locations
  - refresh token will be generated by the script so leave it blank for now

### part V - setting up obs
  - open obs and click on "Tools" at the top
  - if you installed obs-websockets correctly there should be a "WebSockets Sever Settings (4.x) Compat" button in the dropdown
  - click it and make sure it the "Enable Websockets server" box is checked as well as the "Enable authentication" box
  - change the "Password" field to whatever password you want then update the respective line in the config file
  - create two text sources called "snack status" and "raid status"
